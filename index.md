My name is Yannis Spiliopoulos and I am a PhD student at the Computer
Science Department in Columbia University. I am a member of the Software Systems
Laboratory and my advisor is assistant professor <a
href="https://roxanageambasu.github.io/">Roxana Geambasu</a>. I am currently
working on developing new abstractions that will help promote responsible data
management, transparency and accountability on the web.
